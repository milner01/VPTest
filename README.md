# VPTest

The approach I've taken aims to demonstrate a Domain Driven Design approach within a Mediator Command/Query pattern. I have not included any Events or unit tests. The code will not compile. I have not set up the boiler plate code required to create the database, resolve the DI interfaces and Entity Framework as I don't believe it's the reason for this test.

I have added some discussion within the query command stating what I would do differently within a full stack environment. 

I have added some basic empty/null validation on some of the request entities, as well as validating the Sell Price is identical from the request via front end to what is stored in the database.
